# My i3 config

It's here so that I can keep track of it more easily, plus branches for different machines (maybe, the idea was good in my head)

## Contributing / Using my stuff

Feel free to use my shit, if you want. Initial i3-gaps/compton set up borrowed from a [friend](https://githubcom/bownairo), 
you can find his configs [here](https://github.com/bownairo/yoga900i3).

## How does she look?

 Whomst the fuck knows?
