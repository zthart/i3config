# My i3 config

It's here so that I can keep track of it more easily, plus branches for different machines (maybe, the idea was good in my head)

## Contributing / Using my stuff

Feel free to use my shit, if you want. Initial i3-gaps/compton set up borrowed from a [friend](https://githubcom/bownairo), 
you can find his configs [here](https://github.com/bownairo/yoga900i3).

To put all this stuff in the right place, try this:
```shell
$ cd ~/.config
$ git clone https://github.com/zthart/i3config.git i3
$ mkdir i3status
$ ln -s ~/.config/i3/i3status.conf ~/.config/i3status/config
```

This assumes that both the `i3` and `i3status` directories have not yet been created in the `~/.config` directory

## How does she look?
